## Notes on learning British Sign Language (BSL)

Of course, this chrome extension is not designed to be an all-in-one tool to learn BSL, rather a fun introductory way to learn some signs semi-passively.

For example, BSL has it's own grammar system which isn't covered at all by this extension.

Like learning any language, you'll want to use multiple resources and ideally have regular interaction with experienced users of the language!

## Access via chrome web store

Hopefully coming soon!
